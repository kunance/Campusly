          20. FAIR HOUSING ACT.<br>
          (a) Overview. Property owners and managers (“Owners/Managers”) are subject to the federal Fair Housing Act, which, in summary, prohibits discrimination “against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of . . . rental of a dwelling,” refusals to rent or negotiate, denials of rental availability, and preferential advertisements because of or based on “race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.”
          Company supports Equal Housing Opportunity and encourages Owners/Managers using the Site to follow appropriate guidelines to comply with the federal Fair Housing Act, as well as any applicable state and local regulations. All users are hereby informed that all property rental offers are available on an equal opportunity basis.<br>
          (b) Responsibilities of Owners/Managers. Under the law Owners/Managers may not discriminate in the rental of property on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin and may not instruct their agents to convey on their behalf any limitations in the rental. Agents, too, may not discriminate or comply with requests from  Owners/Managers to do so. For example, Owners/Managers and their agents cannot establish discriminatory terms or conditions in the rental of a property or deny that housing is available based on the race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin of a prospective tenant.<br>
          (c) Renter’s Rights. Users seeking to rent an apartment, home or condo (“Tenants”) have the right to expect that housing will be available without discrimination or other limitations based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. Therefore, Tenants have the right to treatment free from discriminatory limitations on housing communities or locations and discrimination in the pricing or financing of housing. They may also expect reasonable accommodations in rules, practices, procedures, and services for persons with disabilities and freedom from harassment or intimidation for exercising their fair housing rights.<br><br>
          21. FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.<br>
          (a) Tenants. Each Tenant further understands that by clicking “I Agree” below, Tenant is providing “written instructions” under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act authorizing Company to obtain information from Tenant’s personal credit profile or other information from Experian. Such authorization is given to Company solely to access and share an abbreviated version of Tenant’s credit report and VantageScore credit score with those Owners/Managers of the specific properties on which Tenant makes offers through the Site for renting/leasing purposes only. A paper copy of the applicable electronic record may be obtained upon request to info@rented.co for a fee of $20. Tenant may contact Company to dispute the accuracy or completeness of any of the information contained therein.
          The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows each Tenant to obtain a disclosure from every credit reporting agency of the nature and substance of all information in Tenant’s file at the time of Company’s request. Full disclosure of information in your file at Experian must be obtained directly from Experian by calling 888-397-3742 or logging on to www.experian.com/consumer. The credit report obtained by Company is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Experian information required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar state laws. Each Tenant is entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer reporting agency free of charge under the following circumstances: (i) Tenant have been denied credit, insurance or employment within the past sixty (60) days as a result of Tenant’s credit report, (ii) Tenant certifies in writing that Tenant is unemployed and intends to apply for employment in the sixty (60)-day period beginning on the date on which Tenant made the certification, (iii) Tenant is a recipient of public welfare assistance, (iv) Tenant has reason to believe that Tenant’s file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud, or (v) annually at www.annualcreditreport.com. Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act permits each Tenant to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in Tenant’s credit file, although accurate information cannot be changed. Tenant does not have to purchase Tenant’s credit report or other information from Company to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in Tenant’s Experian file or to receive a copy of Tenant’s Experian consumer credit report.  Tenants have the right to purchase a consumer credit score directly from Experian. Experian’s National Consumer Assistance Center provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by Company. The disclosure report must be obtained directly from Experian. Consumers residing in the States of Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont may receive a free copy of their consumer credit report once per year and residents of the State of Georgia may receive two copies per year. Additionally, Fraud Alerts are available to any eligible consumers—free of charge—from a national consumer reporting agency.<br>
          (b) Owners/Managers.<br>
          Company provides a VantageScore® credit score via VantageScore Solutions, LLC to Owners/Managers of those properties on which a Tenant has made an offer through the Site.  Such credit score may or may not be used by a Tenant’s lenders, and is not an endorsement or guarantee of a Tenant’s creditworthiness as seen by lenders.  Owners/Managers must be aware that there are many scoring models used in the marketplace, each with its own set of factors and scale.  The information and credit scoring may be different than that used by a lender.  The VantageScore credit score may not be identical in every respect to any other credit score produced by another company or used by a Tenant’s lender. A Tenant’s VantageScore credit score is calculated using actual data from the Tenant’s credit file at the time of Company’s request.  Owners/Managers must keep in mind, however, that other factors, such as length of employment and annual salary, are often taken into consideration by lenders when making decisions about Tenant.  How each lender weighs its chosen factors may vary, but the exact formula used to calculate Tenant’s score is proprietary.  Also note that each consumer reporting agency has its own set of data, resulting in a separate VantageScore credit score for each of a Tenant’s credit files. Owners/Managers agree to request VantageScore credit scores for their use alone for renting/leasing purposes only.  All VantageScore credit scores provided hereunder must be held in strict confidence and may never be sold, licensed, copied, reused, disclosed, reproduced, revealed or made accessible, in whole or in part, to any person except as required by law.<br><br>
          22.  PURCHASES.  All services and other transactions purchased through the Site (“Transactions”) are governed by these Terms of Use.  Additional terms and conditions may also apply to specific portions, services or features of the Site.  All such additional terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms of Use.  YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant to Company the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf.  Company also reserves the right, with or without prior notice, and for any reason or no reason, to bar any user from making or completing any or all Transaction(s) or refuse to provide any user with any service.
